The Muni bus and rail lines will also take you everywhere for cheap, but they can be time consuming. If you plan on staying within the city limits, I recommend skipping the rental.</div>

      	San Francisco is the cultural, commercial and financial center of Northern California. San Francisco was founded on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain established Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de Asis a few miles away, all named for St. Francis of Assisi. The California Gold Rush brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time.
      </p>
