The airport is one of the largest in the world, and extremely convenient to Santa Monica and places South, but it can be a trek to Hollywood or places outside of the city. For those headed to Hollywood or Burbank, from domestic flights – consider Burbank airport instead. It’s much easier.</div>

Uber is great in Los Angeles, but if you’ll be moving around frequently, drives can be over 20-30 minutes at a time and can really add up. Downtown Los Angeles to Beverly Hills can often take an hour.</div>
